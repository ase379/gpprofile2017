# Introduction #

GpProfile is a source code instrumenting profiler for Delphi.

Source codes for gpprofile2011 can be compiled using Delphi 2007 and are not Delphi 2009 (and newer) compliant.

Executable file (gpprof.exe) is able to work and profile sources for Delphi 2009, 2010, XE as well as the sources for older versions of Delphi.

# Details #

Easy as 1-2-3:

1) Start gpprof.exe and open your Delphi project file (.dpr)

2) Check procedures, for which you want to measure execution time. Click "Instrument" button. Special calls will be added in each chosen procedure.

3) Copy gpprof.pas and gpprofh.pas into your application sources folder. Build your application in Delphi, run it, do some tasks and close.

After that return to GpProfile window and enjoy the results! :)
